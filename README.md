Fresh out of [Maker's Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), I am looking to start my career as a Junior Full-Stack Developer.

With a background in geography and marketing, I decided to take the leap to learn to code after feeling unfulfilled and without direction.

I have always enjoyed technology and being creative. Now seeing how these two aspects come together when coding excites me. Being able to create things myself has brought out my technical side.

I would like to nurture my growing passion for writing code in a work environment that will encourage me to maximise my learning, as well as one that engages with best practices.
